## Description

Given an array of integers `citations` where `citations[i]` is the number of citations a researcher received for their `ith` paper and `citations` is sorted in **ascending order**, return _the researcher's h-index_.

According to the [definition of h-index on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index): The h-index is defined as the maximum value of `h` such that the given researcher has published at least `h` papers that have each been cited at least `h` times.

You must write an algorithm that runs in logarithmic time.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** citations = \[0,1,3,5,6\]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** \[0,1,3,5,6\] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 0, 1, 3, 5, 6 citations respectively.
Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** citations = \[1,2,100\]
**Output:** 2

**Constraints:**

*   `n == citations.length`
*   `1 <= n <= 105`
*   `0 <= citations[i] <= 1000`
*   `citations` is sorted in **ascending order**.

## Code 

用 binary search 加速 [[H-Index]] 而已。

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int hIndex(vector<int>& citations) {
        int n = citations.size();
        int l = 0, r = citations.size() - 1;

        while(l < r) {
            int mid = (l + r) / 2;
            if(citations[mid] >= (n - mid)) {
                r = mid;
            } else {
                l = mid + 1;
            }
        }

        return citations[l] >= n - l ? n - l : 0;
    }
};

```
