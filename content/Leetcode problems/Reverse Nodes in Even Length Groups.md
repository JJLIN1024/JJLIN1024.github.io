## Description

You are given the `head` of a linked list.

The nodes in the linked list are **sequentially** assigned to **non-empty** groups whose lengths form the sequence of the natural numbers (`1, 2, 3, 4, ...`). The **length** of a group is the number of nodes assigned to it. In other words,

*   The `1st` node is assigned to the first group.
*   The `2nd` and the `3rd` nodes are assigned to the second group.
*   The `4th`, `5th`, and `6th` nodes are assigned to the third group, and so on.

Note that the length of the last group may be less than or equal to `1 + the length of the second to last group`.

**Reverse** the nodes in each group with an **even** length, and return _the_ `head` _of the modified linked list_.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/10/25/eg1.png)

**Input:** head = \[5,2,6,3,9,1,7,3,8,4\]
**Output:** \[5,6,2,3,9,1,4,8,3,7\]
**Explanation:**
- The length of the first group is 1, which is odd, hence no reversal occurs.
- The length of the second group is 2, which is even, hence the nodes are reversed.
- The length of the third group is 3, which is odd, hence no reversal occurs.
- The length of the last group is 4, which is even, hence the nodes are reversed.

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/10/25/eg2.png)

**Input:** head = \[1,1,0,6\]
**Output:** \[1,0,1,6\]
**Explanation:**
- The length of the first group is 1. No reversal occurs.
- The length of the second group is 2. The nodes are reversed.
- The length of the last group is 1. No reversal occurs.

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/11/17/ex3.png)

**Input:** head = \[1,1,0,6,5\]
**Output:** \[1,0,1,5,6\]
**Explanation:**
- The length of the first group is 1. No reversal occurs.
- The length of the second group is 2. The nodes are reversed.
- The length of the last group is 2. The nodes are reversed.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1, 105]`.
*   `0 <= Node.val <= 105`

            head->next = prev;
            prev = head;
